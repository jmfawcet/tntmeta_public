## Overview

This repository accompanies the manuscript **“Forgetting as a
Consequence of Retrieval Suppression: A Meta-Analytic Review”**. 
The project provides a comprehensive meta-analysis of the **Suppression-Induced
Forgetting (SIF)** effect observed within the **Think/No-Think (TNT)** paradigm.

The meta-analysis synthesizes over **500 effects from 120 studies**,
including both published and unpublished work, and evaluates
methodological factors that influence the magnitude and reliability of
SIF.

## Abstract

Suppressing retrieval of a memory when faced with a reminder has been shown to reduce the probability 
of that memory coming to mind in the future, a phenomenon known as Suppression-Induced Forgetting (SIF). 
However, efforts to observe SIF have sometimes failed, leading some to question the robustness of the 
effect. To address this issue, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of SIF within the Think/No-Think 
paradigm including several key methodological variants to the original design. Across 500 effects from 
120 studies, we observed a consistent aggregate SIF effect (d ≈ 0.20 – 0.40) measured using either same 
probe (SIF ≈ 6%), independent probe (SIF ≈ 5-6%) or recognition (SIF ≈ 2-4%) tests. Notably, there was 
considerable methodological variability, and prediction intervals revealed substantial heterogeneity. 
Moderator analyses undertaken to explain this variability found SIF to be credibly larger when using (a) 
relatively more repetitions during the Think/No-Think phase within same probe data; (b) thought 
substitution instructions within same probe data (with the opposite observed for independent probe data); 
and, (c) autobiographical memories (or future worries) as opposed to words or images. Results provide 
compelling evidence of the robustness of the SIF effect while also demonstrating limitations in the 
literature and areas of future interest. These findings not only reinforce theoretical claims about 
the role of inhibitory control in memory regulation but also provide empirically grounded recommendations 
for optimizing study design. As memory control is increasingly implicated in mental health and adaptive 
cognition, the present work establishes a foundation for future translational efforts and sets clear 
methodological benchmarks for the next generation of research into motivated forgetting.

## Public Significance Statement

Forgetting unwanted memories is critical for mental well-being, yet past research has sometimes 
produced mixed results. Our comprehensive meta-analysis of 120 studies demonstrates that 
deliberately preventing the retrieval of a memory makes it harder to recall later. In some cases, 
the forgetting effect was stronger when people received clear instructions on how to suppress 
the memory, when suppressing personal experiences rather than simple words, and after more 
suppression opportunities. These findings offer new insights into how memory control operates and 
how it might be enhanced.
